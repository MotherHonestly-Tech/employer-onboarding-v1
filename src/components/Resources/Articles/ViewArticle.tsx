          That’s because every moment you spend on household tasks is one you
          could have spent bonding with your kids or building your career. If

          Outsourcing.

          So the day after Floyd’s death, I made sure to join my company’s
          stand-up Zoom meeting, even though I was reeling from grief and anger.
          The topic du jour? Dog safety. Yes, really. I listened to a 15-minute
          presentation about how to keep dogs safe while working from home, but
          mentally I couldn’t stop mentally replaying the horrifying moment
          Floyd called out for his mother shortly before he took his last
          breath. Floyd’s death went unacknowledged by my company’s leadership
          for another three weeks, presumably while they crafted a careful
          statement. Meanwhile, my Black colleagues and I felt lonelier than
          ever, surrounded by coworkers who didn’t know how to acknowledge our
          anguish, if they knew it existed at all. It’s a loneliness that’s all
          too familiar for Black people, and especially Black women, in the
          professional sphere. Though Black women make up 7.4% of the U.S.
          population, we only hold 1.7% of senior roles in corporate America.
          There are two Black women CEOs on the Fortune 500 list. Because Vice
          President Kamala Harris was elevated to the White House, there are now
          zero Black women senators. And if President Joe Biden follows through
          on his promise to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court
          following Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement, she will be the first
          ever to hold the job.

            Black women are paid an average of 63 cents for each dollar paid to
            non-Hispanic white men. Companies can help remedy this disparity by
            performing routine compensation audits and taking concrete steps to
            close any gaps in pay, but they must also make sure that
            opportunities are being evenly distributed, too. A Lean In report on
            The State of Black Women in Corporate America found that Black women
            are much less likely than their non-Black colleagues to interact
            with senior leaders at work, and Black women are much less likely to
            say their manager gives them opportunities to manage people and
            projects. It’s pretty simple: Pay us what we deserve and give us
            time to shine in front of the people who matter most.
